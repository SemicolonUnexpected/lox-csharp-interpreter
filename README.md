# lox-csharp-interpreter

An implementation of an interpreter for the Lox language based on the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/)

## Under Construction

This repository is a work in progress. I have recently finished implementing control flow to a basic level so the language is now Turing Complete.
